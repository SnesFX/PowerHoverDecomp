# PowerHoverDecomp

* A w.i.p. decompilation of Power Hover (mobile ver)

# 40% Complete (Should still be fully playable through the Unity Editor)

* Gotta fix main menu

* Remove purchases

* and more (too lazy to document them all)

# How to setup

* [Grab a copy of Unity 2019.4.17f1](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/667c8606c536/UnityDownloadAssistant-2019.4.17f1.exe)

* [Grab A Copy of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (Not really required unless ur gonna fork it and help with the decomp lol)
